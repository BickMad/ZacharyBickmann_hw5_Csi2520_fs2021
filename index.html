                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Zachary Bickmann, and I am currently attending Oakland University in pursuit of graduating 
                    with Information Technology as my major. I am from Rochester, Michigan and I have lived here for
                    most of my life. Although when I was in the 6th grade, I had to move to Virginia. For two years I
                    lived in Ashburn Virginia, I moved here because my dad got relocated, he works for Volkswagen. 
                    I then moved back to Michigan right as I was going into high school.

                    When I was younger I wanted to be in the NFL, but obviously, that did not work out. As I grew up
                    I grew closer and closer to technology until I realized that it was something that I would want to 
                    work with for the rest of my life. So I chose the path of Computer Science. Soon after 
                    selecting that path, I realized how much I hate math. As a result of my dislike for math, I chose to 
                    switch to a major in Information Technology.
